# Aim trainer

## Project Description 

My app is called Aim trainer. It's a reaction and aiming training aid. 1 player can attempt to target and click dots that appear on screen as fast as they can to train for fps games. The game will track targets clicked within the adjustable time limits and display a total of the targets clicked so that users can compare their score for progress tracking. I'd like to add a feature to have dynamically sized targets.
